## Firebase Authentication
- Most apps want to know the user's identity.
- Knowing the user's identity allows the app to securely store data in the cloud and provide a consistent personalized experience to the user.
- Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users in your app.
- It supports popular authentication methods such as password, phone number, Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
- It integrates with other Firebase services and uses standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, making it easy to integrate with custom backends.
- By default, authenticated users can read and write data in Realtime Database and Cloud Storage.
  - Administrators can control users' access permissions through Firebase Database Rules and Storage Security Rules.
